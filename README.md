# ReiNX-Spoofer (mod by carcaschoi)
This repo has a tiny mod of this original [repo](https://git.nicholemattera.com/NicholeMattera/ReiNX-Spoofer) by NicholeMattera.

# How it works & what is the usage:
Deceive ReiNX when running atmosphere, so thst you can spoof tinfoil & enjoy ReiNX unique services (ex. show games image in hbg shop)

# What is the different between original repo & this modded repo
**I have improved the user experience**
* change titles folder to contents folder so it can compatible to the latest version of atmosphere
* Add toolbox.json file so you can toggle this plugin on or off freely by using [tesla menu](https://github.com/WerWolv/Tesla-Menu/)(with [ovl-sysmodule](https://github.com/WerWolv/ovl-sysmodules)) or [Deepsea toolbox](https://github.com/Team-Neptune/DeepSea-Toolbox)
* Spoof the latest version of ReiNX(3.0) instead of 2.4 

# How to install
* download the latest releases from [here](https://github.com/carcaschoi/ReiNX-Spoofer-mod/releases/latest) & extract to the root of sd card

# Known bug:
* If some homebrew apps are forced to use atmosphere, They maybe crash. (example: [nightfall](https://github.com/D3fau4/NightFall))
* **Solution**: Disable the plugin & reboot the console before use these app.
